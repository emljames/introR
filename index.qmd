# Overview

This introductory R workshop has been put together for the York Psychology ECR Forum. The 2025 workshop will take place as follows:

-   **Time and date:** 2pm-4pm, Wednesday 29th October
-   **Location:** Psychology PC Lab (PS/A/203)
-   ***All welcome***

The session will provide an introduction to R, providing you with the basic skills for getting started in using R for your own research. We will prioritise skills for data wrangling using a set of tools referred to as the *tidyverse*. The course is aimed at complete beginners in R -- **no programming experience or prior knowledge of R is required.**

The workshop will be led by [Emma James](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/james,-emma/), with support from [Jamie Cockcroft](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/postdocs/cockcroft,-jamie/). Both Emma and Jamie use R regularly in their research, and are experienced in supporting learners without any programming backgrounds.

# Before the workshop

Before the workshop, please follow all the set-up steps on the [set-up page](https://emljames.github.io/introR/setup.html).

# Workshop content

The main aim of this workshop is to introduce you to some key data processing tools that showcase why R can be an excellent choice for your data analysis. In doing so, we hope to give you the motivation to invest time in developing your skills in R, and the confidence to do so.

In this workshop, we will walk through four main sections:

1.  [**Navigating R**](https://emljames.github.io/introR/navigating_R.html)
    -   Why *R* and *RStudio*
    -   RStudio panes
    -   Objects
    -   Functions and packages
2.  [**Cleaning data in R**](https://emljames.github.io/introR/data_cleaning.html)
    -   Select relevant variables
    -   Rename variables
    -   Filter for relevant data
3.  [**Transforming data in R**](https://emljames.github.io/introR/data_transformation.html)
    -   Calculate participant averages
    -   Create new variables
    -   Saving datasets
4.  [**Reproducible research practices**](https://emljames.github.io/introR/reproducibility.html)
    -   The benefits of coding
    -   Always comment your code!
    -   Using R Markdown for readable outputs

This is quite an ambitious amount to achieve in two hours! It's fairly likely that we will not get through everything, but we have deliberately left it flexible to adapt to attendees on the day. The materials are written so that you should be able to work through them independently at a later stage. You can also find some [suggested resources](https://emljames.github.io/introR/resources.html) for further learning.

# During the workshop

### Workshop format

This is a "live coding" style workshop: Emma will walk through the content step-by-step for attendees to follow along on their own computers. Independent exercises provide opportunities to apply this knowledge, and allow us to re-group if people have fallen behind.

### Ask for help when you need it

This is an informal setting, so please raise your hand whenever you have questions or need something explaining differently. Many aspects of working in R are not obvious when you encounter them for the first time, so no question is too silly to ask!

Jamie will come to your rescue if you fall behind or something isn't working as expected, and we will pause to get everyone back on track as needed.

### Sticky notes

You should have two coloured sticky notes. Please use these as instructed to indicate when you have finished an exercise, or have fallen behind and need us to slow down.

### Code of conduct

We are all learners at this workshop. Please respect that others might require a slower pace to you (you can always multi-task a little if you're ahead of the game!). We expect all instructors and attendees to be welcoming and inclusive, and respect each other's progress at all times. If you believe someone is violating this code of conduct, please let us know so that we can take the appropriate action to address the situation.
